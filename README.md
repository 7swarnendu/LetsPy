* Refresh the basics of Python language - which was covered on 1st Day
  * list
  * tuple
  * dictionary
  * sets
* Introduction to Data Science 
  * What is Data Science
  * Business Intelligence Vs Data Science
  * Lifecycle of Data Science
  * Case study
* Introduction to Pandas 
  * Installation ``!pip install pandas``
  * Covering the basics of library's main data structures - dataframes and series.
  * Working with DataFrame - dives a bit deeper into the functionality of DataFrames which shows how to inspect, select, filter, merge, combine, and group your data.
  * Using ``pandas`` with [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hesh97/titanicdataset-traincsv) - Kaggle's beginner friendly problem statement so that one should apply the learnings of the first two parts in order to do basic analysis.
* Introduction to Numpy
  * Installation ``!pip install numpy``
  * Numpy 1D Array
  * Numpy 2D Array
  * Multidimensional Array
  * Array concatenation & splitting & subarrays
  * Difference between dynamic-type list and fixed-type (Numpy-style) array 
* Introduction to matplotLib
  * Installation - ``!pip install matplotlib``
  * Plot two dataframe columns as a scatter plot
  * Plot column values as a bar plot
  * Line plot with multiple columns
  * Save plot to file
  * Bar plot with group by
  * Stacked bar plot with group by, percentage counts
  * Stacked bar plot with two-level group by
  * Stacked bar plot with two-level groupby, percentages normalized to 100%
  * Stacked bar plot with a single groupby, percentages normalized to 100%
  * Plot a histogram of column values
  * Date histogram
* Introduction to Scikit-learn - Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits using Scikit - Learn Beginner Friendly ML project.
  * Installation ``!pip install -U scikit-learn``
  * This tutorial will help folks, to understand basics of ML - i.e. how to do Exploratory Data Analysis with the help of matplotlib and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  * Preprocess the data with normalization + split the data into training and test sets.
  * If time permits, will do KMeans on top of this.
